/**
 * # Router
 * The router is responsible for mapping URLs to components.
 *
 * You can see the state of the router by inspecting the read-only field `router.navigating`.
 * This may be useful for showing a spinner, for instance.
 *
 * ## Concepts
 * Routers and component instances have a 1:1 correspondence.
 *
 * The router holds reference to a number of "outlets." An outlet is a placeholder that the
 * router dynamically fills in depending on the current URL.
 *
 * When the router navigates from a URL, it must first recognizes it and serialize it into an
 * `Instruction`.
 * The router uses the `RouteRegistry` to get an `Instruction`.
